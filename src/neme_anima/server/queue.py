"""Single-worker async job queue with cancellation + event broadcast.

Jobs run **one at a time** so the GPU isn't shared. The queue keeps an internal
ordered list (`_jobs`) and a single asyncio task that pulls from it and runs
the user-supplied `runner` coroutine. Pending jobs can be cancelled instantly;
running jobs receive a cancellation token they should poll periodically.
