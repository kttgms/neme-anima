"""Per-video extraction cache metadata + freshness comparison.

The detection pipeline (scenes → detect → track) is the expensive phase of
``run_extract``: it scales with video length and is dominated by ONNX/YOLO
inference. The output (scenes.parquet + tracklets.parquet) lives in
``<project>/output/cache/<video_stem>/`` and lets ``run_rerun`` skip those
stages and re-evaluate identification + selection + tagging only.

The catch: the cache is only valid as long as the scene / detect / track
thresholds that produced it match the *current* thresholds. If the user
tightens ``track_thresh`` and reruns, they'll get the old tracks. The UI
hides that footgun by disabling Re-process when the cache is stale and
disabling Extract when there's nothing scan-affecting to redo.

This module is the bookkeeping for that:

  * :class:`ExtractionCacheMeta` is the snapshot stamped at extract time.
  * :func:`stamp_meta` writes it to ``cache/<video_stem>/extraction_meta.json``.
  * :func:`cache_state` returns one of "none" / "current" / "stale" given
    the current thresholds — what the UI consumes to decide button states.

Only the scene / detect / track sections are tracked. Identification,
frame selection, cropping, dedup, and tagging are all re-applied by
Re-process, so changes to those don't invalidate the cache.
