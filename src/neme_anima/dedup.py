"""Cross-tracklet perceptual deduplication of kept crops.

The in-tracklet ``frame_select`` already enforces a minimum frame gap so picks
inside a single tracklet aren't on top of each other. Near-duplicates that
leak past that pass come from elsewhere: OP/ED scenes repeated across
episodes, near-identical poses across separate shots in the same scene, two
tracklets that happen to land on the same pose. This module catches that
class of duplicate by embedding every kept crop with CCIP — already loaded
for identification, no new model — and moving the lower-scoring members of
each near-duplicate group to ``rejected/`` so the user can recover them if
the threshold was wrong.

Off by default. Default distance threshold (0.02) is well below the
identification floor (0.15 strict / 0.20 loose), so it only collapses crops
that are essentially the same image — not different poses of the same
character.
