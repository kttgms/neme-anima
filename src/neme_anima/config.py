    collapses *locally* repeated frames: comparing every kept crop to
    every other kept crop across the whole video also collapsed
    legitimately distinct shots that happened to be visually similar

    kept crops for them to be considered duplicate-eligible — at 24

    a typical anime shot. Set to 0 to compare across the whole video
    (legacy behaviour, useful for very short clips).

    ``distance_threshold`` defaults to 0.02 — strict enough that only
    crops which are essentially the same image collapse together. The
    looser 0.05 default used previously also caught near-duplicates
    of different poses inside the same shot, which the windowed pass
    can now afford to leave in place since it never compares across
    distant cuts anyway.
