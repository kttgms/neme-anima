"""Stage-progress callback interface for the pipeline.

The pipeline runs on a worker thread inside the server, but is also invoked
directly from the CLI. Both paths import :class:`PipelineProgress` and call its
methods at stage boundaries; the no-op default lets the CLI run without any
plumbing while the server installs a real reporter that publishes events to
the WebSocket broadcaster.
