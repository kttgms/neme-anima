"""Tests for the extraction-cache freshness module.

The pipeline-side stamping is exercised via run_extract in the existing
e2e tests; this file covers the logic in isolation: stamping, reading,
the three-way state computation, and corruption tolerance. The state
machine is what drives the Sources-tab Extract / Re-process button
disable rules — getting it wrong silently misroutes users to a wasted
re-scan or a stale-cache trap, so coverage matters.
